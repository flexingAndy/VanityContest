[c/00C4CC:About this Mod]
This modification adds vanity items from the Journey's End Vanity Contest, i might also add other vanity(not from the contest) related items in the future.
Everything in this mod is subject to change keep that in mind.

[g:5][c/F66A4F: Reason]
I mainly created this mod to appreciate the work of other people. And i also choose simple stuff to add into this mod since my modding and drawing skill are not that good. (And i have to resprite some items by my own.)
I am currently working really hard on it since i have a lot of spare time on my hand. Also trying to get it released before 1.4 ~

[g:5][c/F66A4F: Community]
Most of those items/sprites were created by the community and therefore were already available for me to use [I've asked them to use it though], i also created some sprites by myself from artwork/ideas which i found good.
